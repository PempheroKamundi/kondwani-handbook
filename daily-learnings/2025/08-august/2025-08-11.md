## What I Learned Today

### Discovered Crunchydata PostgreSQL Playground
- **Main Concept**: CrunchyData is a platform that offers managed PostgreSQL instances. They have a playground where you can learn PostgreSQL, both for advanced and basic users
- **Source**: https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground/learn-sql
- **Key Insights**:
  - I discovered this platform while watching Djangocon US 2024 videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppg8-iAwd34)
  - I honestly was not interested in the presentation, because they were speaking about Postgres internals, which really don't apply much to me at this stage in my career
  - Nonetheless, they mentioned the playground, which I found really helpful. I then visited the page and started playing around
  - I am currently translating Django ORM commands to their equivalent PostgreSQL commands
  - It's fascinating how much deeper understanding I have of how these commands translate to SQL commands

## Reflections

Sometimes, it's not about what's being shown, but about how that will lead you to something else important

## Action Items

- âœ… Practice PostgreSQL commands by translating between Django ORM and PostgreSQL back and forth

**Difficulty**: Intermediate 
**Would Recommend**: Yes - great for deeper understanding of how Django ORM works

### Learnt the different Partitioning strategies for Databases
- **Main Concept**: Databases can be partitioned both vertically and horizontally to improve performance
- **Source**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4&t=4719s
- **Key Insights**:
  - Vertical partitioning is about splitting the database table by columns 
  - Horizontal partitioning is about splitting the table by rows 
  - The idea is the smaller the dataset, the better the performance 
  - For example, a users table can be partitioned into user info and user bio. Instead of fetching the entire table, we can only fetch a subset of the data (Vertical partitioning)
  - Horizontal simply means splitting the data by Year, Geography, etc. This can be done within the same database, or fully distributed to other databases (Now this is the concept called Sharding)

## Reflections

The smaller the dataset, the faster the performance
